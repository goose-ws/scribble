Attached is a speech-to-text transcript of the entire session. Act as a TTRPG Scribe and summarize the provided session transcript file. Bear in mind this is a raw, machine-generated transcript, which may contain speech-to-text errors.

A few things for context:
The campaign is [Campaign Name], a [System Name, e.g., Dungeons & Dragons 5e, Pathfinder 2e] game. We play using [Platform, e.g., Foundry VTT, Roll20, Discord].

The translation of usernames to character names is as follows. Please refer to individuals only by their character name in the summary:

With the transcript, please follow these steps:
1. Analyze the full content of the attached text files. Try to account for any speech-to-text transcription errors, nicknames, or misinterpreted words. Use context clues to piece together the best overall understanding of the events that transpired.
2. Identify key plot developments, important player character decisions, major combat encounters, and any new NPCs, locations, or significant items that were introduced. Filter out any off-topic remarks, side conversations, or dialogue that is not relevant to the game's story. The summary does not need to include numeric details, such as damage dealt or healing received.
3. Synthesize this information into a concise summary. While some player characters may have been more active or vocal than others, please try to at least mention each player in the recap.

The final output should be in a well-structured narrative style. Use Discord style formatting/markdown. Your response will be directly sent to Discord via webhook, without additional parsing, so no need for a prompt confirmation or follow up. Try to keep the summary under 4000 characters.
